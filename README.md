This is a basic clone of Amazon.com, created by me to enhance my knowledge of HTML and CSS. The website utilizes vanilla CSS and HTML, and is a good project for anyone who wants to enhance their web dev skills. While developing it, I tried to follow best coding practices that I am familiar with. However, learning is an ongoing process.

Thanks for reading <3
